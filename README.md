# Wine_Authentication
A simple authentication process for wines using a tag code.

### Design Plan
This project is part of a homework or technical interview for the Junior Developer position at Offset.

* Use PHP to implement the web service and mimic the experience that you can view at https://www.danaestates.com/#vineyards/authenticity.

* Use 0PA00AAAB46602 as test code when a valid authenticion code is entered, or if you enter any wrong number, an error message is displayed.

* Apply clean concise coding.

* No need to work out a fancy design.


### Overview

* An XML file is created that contains a wine list with unique tag codes.

* Based on the web site given, there is no log-in required. 

* Page content/text is replicated from the given website.

* A text box is present to enter the necessary tag code and a submit button.

* At the lower part of the page is where the information is displayed if a match is found based on the tag code entered by user. If no match is found, a corresponding error message is displayed in the same section.
